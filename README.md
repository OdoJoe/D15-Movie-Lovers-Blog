# D15 Movie Lovers Club

## Placeholder for responsive design example on differing screen types

# Strategy

## <u>Agile</u>
* The Agile framework was applied to this project using Github views and issues tab. I created a template and applied the template to each user story.
* I collected the user stories by interviewing a family member as a mock user.
* I assembled the user stories onto a kanban board in Github under the headings 'To Do', 'In Progress' and 'Done'. Using each column effectively kept the project moving toward completion. Breaking the work up into iterations helped to reduce the enormity of the project to manageable work sessions.
* Not all user stories were effectively completed and have been retained as a baseline for improvemnt and adding features in the future.

## <u>Project Goal</u>
* The idea behind the D15 Movie Lovers Blog was to create a blog that can easily fit in with my previous portfolio projects: PP1 The D15 Movie Lovers Club and PP2 The D15 Movie Lovers Quiz
* I kept the styling, colours and overall look in line with my PP1 and PP2 with a long term goal of merging the three projects together to create a viable club website with member(user) interactivity and contributions with a focus on responsive and simple design
* I wanted Users to register, log in and log out in a simple manner while being able to write a Blog, comment on a blog and edit and delete their own comments.
* Adding a blog to the D15 movile Lovers Club is a powerful way to maintain engagement with the club and foster unity with the club members, club officials and the club presence online

## <u>Scope and structure</u>
The project scope was reduced and simplified as I approached my deadline. I decided to concentrate on coding the blog in a simple fashion with full CRUD functionality intact. 

The user stories relating to 'voting on Monthly Directors best film' and 'submitting suggestions for the next monthly director focus', while not implemented at this stage of development due to timing constraints will be added to the blog at a later date

The blog is designed to represent the blog if it were clicked into from the main D15 Movie Lovers Club (my PP1) as another page to that projects nav bar. Once the user clicks in they are presented with up to 4 Blogs per page, which will paginate into a second page once more than 4 blogs have been written. Users can navigate to 'Home', 'Register', 'Login' and 'About'
